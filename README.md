# PT Mate

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

A Flutter-based private tracker client built with Material Design 3. PT Mate supports torrent browsing, search, and download management across multiple PT site types.

This fork removes community promotion, automatic update checks, device telemetry and the statistics backend. Releases are accessed manually from this repository. See [fork notes](docs/FORK_NOTES.md).

## Features

- Browse torrents, search, view details, favorite items, and perform bulk actions
- Aggregated search across multiple sites
- Downloader integration (`qBittorrent` / `Transmission`)
- Local relay download support
- Backup and restore, including WebDAV
- Cookie Cloud synchronization and batch configuration

## Supported Site Types

- `Gazelle`
- `M-Team`
- `NexusPHP`
- `NexusPHPWeb`
- `RousiPro`
- `Unit3D`
- `Web`

## Cookie Cloud Sync & Critical Security Warning

PT Mate now supports **Cookie Cloud** integration, allowing you to synchronize logged-in PT site cookies from your desktop browser to PT Mate on your mobile device. This avoids tedious manual cookie copying and supports batch site import/update based on site presets.

> [!CAUTION]
> ### ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY & ACCOUNT BAN WARNING (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!)
>
> Cookies are your unique **identity credentials** on PT sites. Leaking them gives absolute control over your accounts to others. Before enabling this feature, you must fully understand and accept the following severe risks:
>
> 1. **NEVER Use Untrusted Public Cookie Cloud Servers**
>    - Server operators or attackers can easily intercept your cookies through server logs or vault database vulnerabilities.
>    - **Highly Recommended**: ONLY use a private, self-hosted Cookie Cloud server instance (e.g., deployed via Docker on your own NAS, VPS, or private network).
> 2. **Severe Account Ban Risks (Multi-IP & Session Hijacking Detection)**
>    - Many Private Tracker (PT) sites enforce extremely strict security rules against simultaneous access from multiple IPs or rapid geographical relocation (e.g., cellular data vs. home broadband).
>    - If PT Mate makes requests using synced cookies over mobile networks (4G/5G/LTE) while your desktop browser is still active on home broadband, the site's security monitors might flag this as **"account sharing" or "session hijacking," resulting in an immediate and permanent account ban**.
>    - **Recommendation**: Exercise extreme caution when using PT Mate on cellular/public networks. Disable auto-sync or refresh for highly sensitive sites when not connected to your home network, or configure appropriate proxies.
> 3. **Encryption is Not Invulnerable**
>    - Although Cookie Cloud uses client-side encryption (AES via key derivation from UUID and password), weak UUIDs or short passwords can still be brute-forced. Always use strong, complex sync credentials.
> 4. **Exceeded Scope Risk (Not Limited to PT Sites)**
>    - By default, browser Cookie Cloud extensions will **synchronize all website cookies in your browser** (including your emails, banking, shopping, and social media sites).
>    - **Security Recommendation**: Configure domain whitelist/blacklist rules in your browser extension to restrict sync strictly to PT sites, avoiding leakage of non-PT high-value sessions.
> 5. **Operating System Constraints & Plaintext Storage Risk**
>    - While the application utilizes platform secure storage pipelines (Keychain/KeyStore), on certain Linux distributions or environments lacking a proper keyring service, the app may fall back to **storing Cookie Cloud credentials in plaintext** within configuration files.
> 6. **Backup Exports & WebDAV Sync Exposures**
>    - The exported backup files and the cloud-synced WebDAV backup payloads **contain the full, unencrypted Cookie Cloud configuration**.
>    - **Security Recommendation**: Store exported backup JSON files securely. Ensure your WebDAV connection **strictly uses the HTTPS protocol** (never HTTP) to prevent man-in-the-middle sniffing of backup data.
> 7. **Runtime Memory Snooping Risk**
>    - At runtime, the application necessarily holds plaintext cookies and credentials in system memory. If your device is compromised by malware, spyware, or processes with root/jailbreak privileges, they could potentially read this sensitive information directly from process memory.
>
> **By enabling this feature, you acknowledge that you fully understand and assume all risks including, but not limited to, account bans, session termination, or data leaks resulting from cookie synchronization.**
